I decided to start with a tutorial on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs for short).\nUnder the project, I wrote a tutorial explaining the various concepts of graphs. The main ones were Directed Graph and Directed Acyclic Graph. In addition to explanation of the theory, I developed examples using NetworkX and found various real-world applications of these concepts.\nMoreover, I wrote about topological sort - one of the most basic algorithms for working with DAGs. It was very interesting to describe step-by-step how this algorithm works in a clear and comprehensible manner.\nYou can read about it in details here.\n✅ Results The main result of my work is the topological sort tutorial.\n ✅ Corresponding merged PR: [GSoC contribution] Topological sort notebook.  Furthermore, during the work on DAGs module of NetworkX, I opened several PRs with improvements:\n ✅ Merged PR to improve code base: [GSoC contribution] Improving functions descendants and ancestors in dag.py ✅ Merged PR to improve documentation: [GSoC contribution] Adding examples to docstrings in dag.py  🥳 Conclusion I want to express my deep gratitude to my mentors: Eric Ma and Ross Barnowski. It was a real pleasure to work with you guys. I look forward to further productive cooperation.\n","date":1629456236,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631981395,"objectID":"1a9a7b7abeefc6ca6058a479d330a7b0","permalink":"https://example.com/post/gsoc-2021-final/","publishdate":"2021-08-20T13:43:56+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/gsoc-2021-final/","section":"post","summary":"This is a short post about what I did during the GSoC","tags":["gsoc","networkx"],"title":"GSoC 2021 Final","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"🌞 ️Summer 2021 I am happy to have been accepted to Google Summer of Code 2021 with the project \u0026ldquo;Pedagogical Interactive Notebooks for Algorithms Implemented in NetworkX\u0026rdquo;. I will be writing code under the mentorship of Eric Ma and Ross Barnowski. The goal of this project is to create Jupyter notebooks that will become detailed and intuitive tutorials containing the ideas behind, explanations and experimental analysis of the algorithms implemented in NetworkX.\nLet me tell you about how I got there.\n👨‍💻 Google Summer of Code The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to students who successfully complete a 10-week free and open-source software coding project during their break from school. The program is open to university students aged 18 or over. The amount of the stipend depends on the purchasing power parity of the country where the student\u0026rsquo;s university is located. Project ideas are listed by host organizations involved in open-source software development, though students can also propose their own project ideas.\nThis year it has been essential to me not to miss the GSoC, so I have written down the estimated dates for the stages that are important for a student.\n⏰ Timeline   ✅ Organizations Announced\n📅  early March \n📝 Students can begin discussing project ideas with open source organizations that accepted to participate as a mentor organization.\n  ✅ Student Application Period\n📅  end of March — mid-April \n📝 Students can register and submit their proposals to mentor organizations.\n  ✅ Application Review Period\n📅  mid-April — mid-May \n📝 Mentor organizations review and select student proposals.\n  ✅ Student Projects Announced\n📅  at the end of the review period \n📝 Accepted students are paired with a mentor and start planning their projects and milestones.\n  The key stage is the Student Application Period. That is when you have to figure out which project you want to work on and make a proposal for what you are going to do for it during the summer.\nFor those lucky ones, who were accepted, there are a few more important stages.\n  ✅ Community Bonding\n📅  from the moment student projects announced — early June \n📝 Students spend a month learning more about their organization\u0026rsquo;s community.\n  ✅ Coding, part 1\n📅  early June — mid-July \n📝 Students work on their Google Summer of Code projects.\n  ✅ First Evaluations\n📅  mid-July \n📝 Mentors and students submit their evaluations of one another.\n  ✅ Coding, part 2\n📅  mid-July — mid-August \n📝 Students work on their Google Summer of Code projects.\n  ✅ Final Evaluations\n📅  mid-August \n📝 Students submit their code, project summaries, and final evaluations of their mentors.\n  ✅ Results Announced\n📅  end of August \n📝 Students are notified of the pass/fail status of their Google Summer of Code projects.\n  😎 My advice The participation process for accepted students can vary from organization to organization. And here I have no recommendations for you.\nBy contrast, I have some advice to help you maximize your chance of being accepted into the GSoC.\n👨‍🏫 Start as early as possible Contact mentors early! The earlier you contact mentors, the earlier you may receive feedback from them to improve your proposal and the higher your chance of being accepted will be.\nThe answers of the mentors will make it clear whether it would be comfortable to work with them in the summer. It gives you more time to find the right mentor organization.\n👨‍🏫 Focus on quality Think about your choice of a project carefully, you are going to be doing it for a couple of months, so it is very important that you choose something you are going to enjoy.\nMake sure you have thought about the project and understood its achievable goals. Your application should convince mentors that you are capable of completing the project. If you are not sure about anything, get in touch with mentors, they are ready to advise you.\nThe proposal template and examples of accepted proposals from previous years would be very useful to you. In my case, I used this proposal template and examples.\nRemember that after you have been accepted, you can edit your proposal at any time.\n👨‍🏫 Show your technical skills Create at least one Pull Request before the Student Application Period ends! The best way to do this is to close an issue from the project. Many projects have issues marked Good First Issue and closing such type of issue would be a good starting point.\nCommit early and commit often! So that mentors can see and review your work.\n✌ That is all I wanted to tell you today. I hope this post will be useful to you. Good luck and have a nice day!\n","date":1626449454,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631980701,"objectID":"1a25614b676fe4b622f9723d7b47bbc8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/gsoc-2021-start/","publishdate":"2021-07-16T18:30:54+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/gsoc-2021-start/","section":"post","summary":"🌞 ️Summer 2021 I am happy to have been accepted to Google Summer of Code 2021 with the project \u0026ldquo;Pedagogical Interactive Notebooks for Algorithms Implemented in NetworkX\u0026rdquo;.
