It's funny, but I could not find a simple guide on how to install Hugo Extended on Ubuntu 20.04 ðŸ˜…

I'll try to fix this annoying gap ðŸ˜Š

All you need to install Hugo Extended is to download the corresponding `.deb` file from the hugo repository
(can be found here ðŸ‘‰ [link](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)).

For now, the corresponding release is `hugo_extended_0.88.1_Linux-64bit.deb`:

```shell
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.88.1/hugo_extended_0.88.1_Linux-64bit.deb
```

After that, it is enough to install this package using [dpkg](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg):

```shell
dpkg --install hugo_extended_0.88.1_Linux-64bit.deb
```

That's all âœŒ
